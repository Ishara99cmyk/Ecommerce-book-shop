# Ecommerce-book-shop

A frontend for an eCommerce bookshop application made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
is a user interface layer that provides a visually appealing and interactive experience for customers and users. 


Incorporating CSS animations and ensuring responsiveness are excellent ways to enhance the user experience of this
eCommerce bookshop application frontend. Here's how you can describe the CSS animations and responsiveness features of this website:

CSS Animations:

Subtle Hover Effects: CSS animations are used to create subtle hover effects on book thumbnails and buttons, providing 
visual feedback when users interact with elements.

Smooth Transitions: Smooth transitions between different sections of the website enhance the flow of the user experience. 
For example, when a user clicks on a book, it smoothly expands to the detailed book page with a fade-in animation.
